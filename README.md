**Major Types of Data**
- Numerical
- Categorical
- Ordinal

**Numerical**

- Represents some sort of quantitative measurement
  - Heights of people, page load times, stock prices, etc.
- Discrete Data
  - Integer based: often counts of some event
    - How many purchases did a customer make in a year?
    - How many times did I flip "heads"?
- Continuous Data
  - Has an infinite number of possible values
    - How much time did it take for a user to chek out?
    - How much rain fell on a given day?

**Categorical**

- Qualitative data that has no inherent mathematical meaning
  - Gender, Yes/No (Binary Data), Race, State of Residence, Product Category, Political Party, etc.
- You can assign numbers to categories in order to represent them more compactly, but the numbers don't have mathematical meaning

**Ordinal**

- A mixture of numerical and categorical
- Categorical data has mathematical meaning
- Example: movie ratings on a 1-5 scale.
  - Ratings must be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
  - But these values have mathematical meaning; 1 means it's a worse movie than a 2
